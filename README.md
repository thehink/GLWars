#GLWars

GLWars is a personal training game I'm making on my free time. I will be focusing 
most on a GPU particle system and multiplayer part.

##Install
As of now no serverside is implented. You only need a webserver because most browsers is limiting local images in WebGL.
When you've set up a webserver, browse ./client/client.html with a modern browser.

##libraries i use:
* THREE.js
* jQuery
* Box2d js-port
